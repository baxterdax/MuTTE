## API Overview

Every request requires an API key:
- **Tenant Key**: `X-API-Key`
- **Admin Key**: `X-Admin-Key`

### Key Endpoints

#### Send an Email
```http
POST /send
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: tenant_api_key

{
   "to": "recipient@example.com",
   "subject": "Hello!",
   "htmlBody": "<h1>Welcome {{name}}!</h1>",
   "variables": { "name": "Ada" },
   "attachments": [
      { "filename": "hi.txt", "content": "SGVsbG8=", "encoding": "base64" }
   ]
}
```
